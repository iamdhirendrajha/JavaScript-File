JavaScript Numbers

comments
JavaScript numbers are primitive data types, and unlike other programming languages, you don't need to declare different numeric types like int, float, etc. JavaScript numbers are always stored in double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754. This format stores numbers in 64 bits:

0-51 bits store the value (fraction)
52-62 bits store the exponent
63rd bit stores the sign


Numeric Types in JavaScript
In JavaScript, numbers play an important role, and understanding their behavior is essential for effective programming. Let’s explore the various aspects of numeric types in JavaScript.

1. The Only Numeric Type
As we know, JavaScript has only one numeric type: the double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754, which means that it doesn’t differentiate between integers and floating-point numbers explicitly. Instead, it uses a unified approach for all numeric values.

Integers and floating-point numbers are both represented using this format.
The numeric precision is 53 bits, allowing for an accurate representation of integer values ranging from -2^53 + 1 to 2^53 - 1.

2. Scientific Notation
JavaScript allows writing extra-large or extra-small numbers using scientific (exponent) notation.

let a  =  156e5;
let b =   156e-5;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
