JavaScript Numbers

comments
JavaScript numbers are primitive data types, and unlike other programming languages, you don't need to declare different numeric types like int, float, etc. JavaScript numbers are always stored in double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754. This format stores numbers in 64 bits:

0-51 bits store the value (fraction)
52-62 bits store the exponent
63rd bit stores the sign


Numeric Types in JavaScript
In JavaScript, numbers play an important role, and understanding their behavior is essential for effective programming. Let’s explore the various aspects of numeric types in JavaScript.

1. The Only Numeric Type
As we know, JavaScript has only one numeric type: the double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754, which means that it doesn’t differentiate between integers and floating-point numbers explicitly. Instead, it uses a unified approach for all numeric values.

Integers and floating-point numbers are both represented using this format.
The numeric precision is 53 bits, allowing for an accurate representation of integer values ranging from -2^53 + 1 to 2^53 - 1.



2. Scientific Notation
JavaScript allows writing extra-large or extra-small numbers using scientific (exponent) notation.

let a  =  156e5;
let b =   156e-5;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);

Output:
15600000
0.00156



3. Integer Precision
Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits.

let a = 999999999999999;
let b = 9999999999999999;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);

Output
999999999999999
10000000000000000



4. Floating Point Precision :
Floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate due to binary representation limitations.

Example

let x = 0.22 + 0.12;   //x will be 0.33999999999999997
To solve this problem, multiply and divide:

let x = (0.22 * 10 + 0.12 * 10) / 10;    // x will be 0.34



let x = 0.22 + 0.12;
let y = (0.22 * 10 + 0.12 * 10) / 10;
console.log(x);
console.log(y);

Output : 
0.33999999999999997
0.34



5. Adding Numbers and Strings
JavaScript uses the `+` operator for both addition and concatenation.
Numbers are added, when strings are concatenated.

// Adding two numbers
let x = 10;
let y = 15;
let z = x + y;
console.log(z);
​
// Concatenating two strings:
​
let a = "10";
let b = "30";
let c  = a + b;
console.log(c);

Output :
25
1030




6. Numeric Strings
JavaScript automatically converts the numeric strings to numbers in most operations like.

let x  = "100" / "10";
let y  = "100" * "10";
let z = "100" - "10";
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
console.log(z);

Output
10
1000



Number Literals
The types of number literals You can use decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.

1. Decimal Numbers
JavaScript Numbers does not have different types of numbers(ex: int, float, long, short) which other programming languages do. It has only one type of number and it can hold both with or without decimal values

let a=33;
let b=3.3;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);


Output
33
3.3



2. Octal Number
If the number starts with 0 and the following digits are smaller than 8. It will be parsed as an Octal Number. 

let x = 0562;
console.log(x);

Output
370



3. Binary Numbers
They start with 0b or 0B followed by 0's and 1's. 

let x = 0b11; 
let y = 0B0111;
​
console.log(x);
console.log(y);

Output
3
7



4. Hexadecimal Numbers
They start with 0x or 0X followed by any digit belonging (0123456789ABCDEF) 

let x = 0xfff;
console.log(x);

Output
4095




Number Coercion in JavaScript
In JavaScript, coercion refers to the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. When different types of operators are applied to values, JavaScript performs type coercion to ensure that the operation can proceed. Let’s explore some common examples of coercion:


1. Undefined to NaN
When you perform an operation involving undefined, JavaScript returns NaN (Not-a-Number).


const res = undefined + 10;
console.log(res); // NaN

Output
NaN




2. Null to 0
The value null is coerced to 0 when used in arithmetic operations.

const total = null + 5;
console.log(total); // 5

Output :
5



3. Boolean to Number
Boolean values (true and false) are converted to numbers: 1 for true and 0 for false.




const n1 = true + 10;
const n2 = false + 10;
​
console.log(n1);
console.log(n2);

Output
11
10




4. String to Number
When performing arithmetic operations, JavaScript converts strings to numbers. If the string cannot be parsed as a valid number, it returns NaN.


const s1 = '42';
const s2 = 'hello';
or
const s2 = Numbers("hello");
​
const strToNum1 = Number(s1);
const strToNum2 = Number(s2);
​
console.log(strToNum1);
console.log(strToNum2);
or
console.log(s2);

Output
42
NaN

output will be the same:
42
NaN



5. BigInts and Symbols
Attempting to coerce Symbol values to numbers results in a TypeError.

const symbol = Symbol('mySymbol');
​
const symToNum = Number(symbol); // TypeError
console.log(symToNum);
Output:

TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a number



Integer conversion
Some operations such as those which work with an array, string indexes, or date/time expect integers. After performing the coercion if the number is greater than 0 it is returned as the same and if the number NaN or -0, it is returned as 0. The result is always an integer.

Fixed-width number Conversion
In Javascript, there are some functions that deal with the binary encoding of integers such as bitwise operators and typedArray objects. The bitwise operators always convert the operands to 32-bit integers.

JavaScript Number Methods
Now, we will use Number methods such as toString(), toExponential(), toPrecision(), isInteger(), and toLocaleString() method. Let's see the examples of these Number methods.


let x = 21
console.log(x.toString());
console.log(x.toExponential());
console.log(x.toPrecision(4));
console.log(Number.isInteger(x));
console.log(x.toLocaleString("bn-BD"));


Output:
21
2.1e+1
21.00
true
২১



Some Facts About Numbers in JavaScript
String Concatenation with Numbers: When you add a string and a number in JavaScript, the result will be a string concatenation.
Javascript numbers which are primarily primitive values can also be defined as objects using a new keyword.
Constants preceded by 0x are interpreted as hexadecimal in JavaScript.   
Javascript numbers are of base 10 by default, but we can use the toString() method to get output in the required base from base 2 to base 36.
Apart from regular numbers, Javascript has BigInt numbers which are integers of arbitrary length.
