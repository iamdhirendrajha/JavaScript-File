// JavaScript if-else

// JavaScript conditional statements allow programs to make decisions based on specific conditions. They control the flow of execution, enabling different actions for different scenarios.

/*
JavaScript if-statement:--->
It is a conditional statement that determines whether a specific action or block of code will run based on a condition. If the condition is true, the code executes; if false, it does not.

Syntax:=
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is True                
    }
// this block or this line of Code to be executed if the condition is Falae                

Now let's understand this with the help of an example:
// JavaScript program to illustrate If statement

let age = 19;

if (age > 18)
console.log("Congratulations, You are eligible to drive");

Output:
Congratulations, You are eligible to drive
