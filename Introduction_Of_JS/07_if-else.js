// JavaScript if-else

// JavaScript conditional statements allow programs to make decisions based on specific conditions. They control the flow of execution, enabling different actions for different scenarios.

/*
JavaScript if-statement:--->
It is a conditional statement that determines whether a specific action or block of code will run based on a condition. If the condition is true, the code executes; if false, it does not.

Syntax:=
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is True                
    }
// this block or this line of Code to be executed if the condition is Falae                

Now let's understand this with the help of an example:
// JavaScript program to illustrate If statement

let age = 19;
if (age > 18)
console.log("Congratulations, You are eligible to drive");

Output:
Congratulations, You are eligible to drive


JavaScript if-else statement:--->
The if-else statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false. It's a way to handle two possible outcomes based on a condition.

Syntax:=
if (condition)
{
    // Executes this block if
    // condition is true
}
else
{
    // Executes this block if
    // condition is false
}

Now let's understand this with the help of example:-->

// JavaScript program to illustrate If-else statement
let i = 10;

if (i < 15)
    console.log("i is less than 15");
else
    console.log("I am Not in if");


Output:-
i is less than 15
