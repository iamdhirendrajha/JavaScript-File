// JavaScript Loops
/*

Loops in JavaScript are used to reduce repetitive tasks by repeatedly executing a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. This makes code more concise and efficient.

In JavaScript, there are three types of Loops :

1. for Loop:-->
The for loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times. It contains initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line.

Example: The below JavaScript program for loop runs from i = 1 to i = 3, incrementing i by 1 each time, and prints "Count:" followed by the current value of i.

for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    console.log("Count:", i);
}
